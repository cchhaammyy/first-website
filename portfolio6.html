        <div class="topic-box">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>A computer is a device for processing, storing, and displaying information (Pottenger et al., 2025). Computers come in different types and sizes depending on their purpose and performance. From the fastest supercomputers used in scientific research to small microcomputers for personal use. Each of the computer types has its own strengths or capabilities in performing various tasks.</p>
            
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Each type of computer has a specific purpose and use. Supercomputers are the fastest and most powerful ones that can handle a lot of data, usually for research. Mainframe computers are big and strong machines that manage huge amounts of information for banks, airlines, or government offices. Mini computers are medium sized and can be used by several people at the same time, often used in small businesses and factories.</p>
            <p>Servers are computers that store and share data to other computers connected in a network. Workstations are powerful desktop computers used for heavy work like designing, editing, or engineering. Lastly, microcomputers are the smallest and most common type that people use at home, in school, or in offices for everyday tasks like typing, studying, or browsing.</p>
