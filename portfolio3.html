            <h1>NUMBER SYSTEM</h1>
            <p>According to Latif et al. (2011), a number system is a set of rules and symbols used to represent a number, or any system used for naming or representing numbers and it is also known as numeral system. It helps people understand how number are written and read. A number system also shows how each digit has a value depending on its position, making it easier to work with different types of numbers like binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.</p>

            <h2>Types of Number Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Decimal System</li>
                <li>Binary System</li>
                <li>Octal System</li>
                <li>Hexadecimal System</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>DECIMAL SYSTEM</h3>
            <p>Decimal numbers are an integral part of our everyday lives, serving as a universal language for expressing quantities, measurements, and mathematical concepts. The decimal number system, also known as the base 10 system, is a fundamental pillar of mathematics and plays a crucial role in various fields, including science, finance, and computer programming (Rosales, 2023).</p>
            <p>The decimal number system is based on the number ten (10), and it employs ten digits 0 to 9 to represent all possible quantities. Each digit's position within a decimal number indicates its value, with the rightmost digit representing the ones place, the next digit to the left representing the tens place, and so on (Rosales, 2023).</p>
            
            <h3>BINARY SYSTEM</h3>
            <p>According to Lande (2014), the binary number system is represented by only two symbols, 0 and 1. Binary number system played an important role in the development of computers in the twentieth century. Nearly all computers use the binary numeral system. The binary system works by combining 0s and 1s to create different values, making it easier for machines to read and process information.</p>
            <p>It is important because computers, phones, and many digital devices use binary to store data, perform calculations, and run programs. This makes the binary system a foundation of modern technology and an essential part of how digital devices function today.</p>

            <h3>OCTAL SYSTEM</h3>
            <p>Octal is a numeral system for representing a numeric value as base 8. Generally, an octal digit is represented as "0" to "7" with the same value as for decimal but with each place a power of 8 (Wikipedia, 2025). The octal system is easier to read than long binary numbers because it groups binary digits into sets of three. This makes it helpful for students and programmers when converting large binary values into a shorter and more understandable form.</p>
            <p>The octal system is also used in some computer operations, such as file permissions in operating systems like Linux, and in older computer technologies. Its significance comes from making binary information simpler and more organized, helping users understand and manage data more easily.</p>
            
            <h3>HEXADECIMAL SYSTEM</h3>
            <p>Hexadecimal, or base 16, has been used as a computer language for decades (Strickland & Jones, 2022). The hexadecimal system uses sixteen symbols, the numbers 0 to 9 and the letters A to F, where A stands for 10 and F stands for 15. It is commonly used because it can represent large binary values in a shorter and easier way.</p>
            <p>The hexadecimal system is significant in computing because it helps students, programmers, and engineers read and work with binary data more clearly. It is often used in programming, memory addresses, color codes in web design, and debugging computer systems. By shortening long binary numbers, hexadecimal makes digital information easier to understand and manage.</p>

            <h1>ANALYSIS / REACTION</h1>
            <p>Learning about different number systems gives a clearer understanding of how numbers work beyond what people normally use in daily life. Most students grow up using the decimal system, so discovering that there are other systems like binary, octal, and hexadecimal feels both new and interesting. Each system has its own role, and all of them are important, especially in computing and modern technology.</p>
            <p>The decimal system or base 10, is the system everyone is most familiar with. It uses digits from 0 to 9, and each digit has a value based on its position. Because it is used in basic counting, money, measurements, and everyday calculations, it feels natural and is easy to understand. Even though decimal is the most common, it is helpful to learn that it is just one example of how numbers can be represented.</p>
            <p>The binary system is one of the most important systems today because it serves as the language of computers. Binary uses only 0 and 1, which seems simple but is powerful. All digital devices like phones, computers, calculators, and even smart appliances operates using binary instructions. Knowing this helps students appreciate that the technology they use daily is built from a very basic yet efficient system.</p>
            <p>The octal system which is base 8, is not as common as decimal or binary, but it has meaningful uses. It groups binary digits into sets of three, making long binary sequences easier to read and convert. This is helpful for students and programmers who need to simplify complex binary numbers. Octal is also used in some computer operations, such as file permissions in certain operating systems, which shows that it still has practical value.</p>
            <p>The hexadecimal system or base 16, is another system widely used in technology. It uses digits 0 to 9 and letters A to F to represent larger values in a compact way. Hexadecimal is used in programming, memory addressing, debugging, and even in choosing colors for web design. By shortening long binary values, it makes digital information more neat and manageable.</p>
            <p>Overall, understanding these number systems helps students see how deeply math is connected to technology. Each system has a specific purpose, and together, they make computing faster, clearer, and more organized. Learning them builds a stronger foundation for understanding how digital tools work behind the scenes. It shows that even if these systems look complicated at first, they become easier when their structure and importance are explained clearly.</p>
