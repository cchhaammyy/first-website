            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>A motherboard is the main circuit board found inside devices like computers, smart TVs, and monitors. It connects and allows communication between all the important parts of the system, such as the CPU, memory, storage, and other hardware components. It also includes different slots and ports where you can attach extra parts like graphics cards, sound cards, USB devices, and internet cables. The motherboard helps transfer data and power between these components so the device can function smoothly.</p>
            <p>It also has chipsets that control how information moves between the processor, memory, and storage. In simple terms, the motherboard acts like the “heart” or “nervous system” of the computer because it keeps everything connected and working together. Without it, none of the parts in a computer would be able to communicate or operate, making it one of the most important parts of any electronic device.</p>
            
            <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>Each type of motherboard has its own features that affect how it performs and what kind of computer it fits best. Some older models like the AT and LPX motherboards were used a long time ago and are now mostly replaced by newer designs. The most common type today is the ATX motherboard because it’s flexible and can support many components, making it great for gaming or high performance computers. Smaller versions like the Micro ATX and Mini ATX are often used for regular desktops since they take up less space but still work well.</p>
            <p>There are also very compact ones like Mini ITX and Pico BTX, which are perfect for small computers or home servers that don’t need much power. Overall, choosing the right motherboard depends on what the user wants to do for example, gaming, schoolwork, or office use. The better the motherboard fits the user’s needs, the smoother and more efficient the computer will run.</p>
