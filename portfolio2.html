                    <h2>Data</h2>
                    <p>Data are streams of raw facts representing events occuring in organization or the physical environment before they have been organized and arranged into a form that people can understand and use (Al-Mamary et al., 2014). Data are just raw numbers, words, or symbols that don’t have clear meaning yet. They still need to be processed or arranged to turn into an information. It is important since it serves as the raw material that later helps in making decision and solving problems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-box">
                    <h2>Information</h2>
                    <p>Information is a data that have been shaped into a form that is meaningful and useful to human beings (Al-Mamary et al., 2014). It is a processed or organized data that people can understand and use. It gives context and meaning to raw facts, making them helpful for decision making and problem solving. Without information, data would just remain random facts with no real purpose.</p>

            <h1>INFORMATION SYSTEM</h1>
            <p>Information Systems (IS) collects, processes, stores, analyzes, and disseminates information for a specific purpose (Rainer et al, 2020). This means that IS takes raw data and makes it more organized so it’s easier to understand and use. This helps people make better decisions. IS also makes communication easier and makes tasks more efficient. In short, IS connects people and technology to make work simpler and faster.</p>

            <h2>Different Types of Support Systems in Information Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Transaction Processing System (TPS)</li>
                <li>Office Automation System (OAS)</li>
                <li>Knowledge Work System (KWS)</li>
                <li>Management Information System (MIS)</li>
                <li>Decision Support System (DSS)</li>
                <li>Executive Support System (ESS)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-box">
            <h3>TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEM (TPS)</h3>
            <p>Transaction Processing System (TPS) are the basic business system that serve the operational level of the organization (Al-Mamary et al., 2014). TPS handles the everyday activites of a business, such as recording sales, payments, and other transactions. It also process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, which helps avoid mistakes and keeps information reliable.</p>
            
            <h3>OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEM (OAS)</h3>
            <p>According to Heidarkhani et al. (2013), the Office Automation System is one of the most widely used types of information systems that will help managers control the flow of information in organizations. OAS handles things like documents, communication, and schedules. It allows information to move smoothly between employees and departments, which improves coordination.</p>

            <h3>KNOWLEDGE WORK SYSTEM (KWS)</h3>
            <p>Knowledge Work System (KWS) is a type of information system that helps knowledge workers create, share, and use knowledge in an organization. KWS helps organize data, analyze it, and turn it into useful knowledge for solving problems or making decisions. It is important because it helps workers be more creative and helps the organization use knowledge in smarter ways.</p>
            
            <h3>MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS)</h3>
            <p>A Management Information System (MIS) is a computer based information system that provides management oriented reporting based on transaction processing and business operations of the organization (Nowduri & AlDossary, 2012). In simple terms, MIS collects data from the daily activities of a business and turns it into reports that managers can easily understand. These reports help managers check how things are going and can plan ahead of time for the business.</p>

            <h3>DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (DSS)</h3>
            <p>According to Asemi et al. (2011), Decision Support System (DSS) is a computer based system intended for use by a particular manager or usually a group of managers at any organizational level in making a decision in the process of solving a semi structured decision. DSS helps the managers in decision making that needs modeling, formulation, calculating, comparing, selecting the best option or predict scenarios (Heidarkhani et al., 2013).</p>
            
            <h3>EXECUTIVE SUPPORT SYSTEM (ESS)</h3>
            <p>Parulian et al. (2023) explained that Executive Support System (ESS) are a computer-based information systems created to aid senior managers in making strategic decisions. ESS offers high level overviews of business performance and data visualization that help executives identify trends and potential issues quickly.</p>

            <h1>ANALYSIS / REACTION</h1>
            <p>“Data” are raw words or numbers that don’t mean much at first. When the data is organized and processed, it turns into “Information”, which helps people understand things better. This is really important for businesses because they need clear information to make the right decisions.</p>
            <p>There are different types of Information Systems for different jobs in a company.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) keeps track of daily tasks like sales and payments quickly and accurately.</li>
                    <li>Office Automation Systems (OAT) include programs like Microsoft Word or Excel, which help employees work together and share documents easily.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge Work Systems (KWS) helps employees share and use ideas and information to solve problems better.</li>
                    <li>Management Information Systems (MIS) take all the daily data and turn it into reports that managers can use to see how the business is doing and can plan ahead of time.</li>
                    <li>Decision Support Systems (DSS) help managers make difficult decisions by showing useful information and options they can compare.</li>
                    <li>Executive Support Systems (ESS) provide top leaders with easy to understand summaries and chart so they can see the big picture and make important decisions.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>These Information Systems work together like a team to help a business work together. They take confusing raw data and turn it into clear and useful information. Without these systems, companies would have a hard time keep tracking of everything and making the right decisions.</p>
            <p>In short, Information Systems are very important for businesses to succeed. They help everyone in the company, from workers doing daily jobs to leaders making big plans. Using these systems, businesses can stay organized and work efficiently.</p>
