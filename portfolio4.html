            <h1>COMPUTER HARDWARE</h1>
            <p>According to Purwanto & Tawar (2024), hardware is a tool or object that can be seen, touched, held and has a certain function. Equipment that is physically visible and can be touched or held. The hardware is in the form of Personal Computers (laptops, desktops), Smartphones, Tablets and Internet Network. These hardware components are essential for enabling users to interact with digital systems and access various software applications. Without such physical devices, effective computing and communication would not be possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-box">
            <h1>SOFTWARE</h1>
            <p>Software is a collection of programs and instructions that tell a computer what to do. Unlike hardware, which you can touch, software is like the invisible brain behind the scenes that makes everything run smoothly. It includes things like apps, operating systems, and games that help you perform tasks on your computer or phone. Software is key to effective business processes in many industries (Gruhn & Striemer, 2018) because it helps automate tasks, manage data, and improve communication, making work faster and more efficient.</p>

            <h2>Types of Software</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>System Software</li>
                <li>Application Software</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="topic-box">
            <h3>SYSTEM SOFTWARE</h3>
            <p>System software is the type of program that helps your computer’s hardware and other applications work together (Awati & Lutkevich, 2024). It controls important things like memory and processing so the computer runs smoothly. You can think of it as the base that supports everything else, making sure all parts of the computer communicate properly. Without system software, you wouldn’t be able to use apps or do much on your computer.</p>
            
            <h3>APPLICATION SOFTWARE</h3>
            <p>An application software (software application, or application, or app for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself, typically to be used by end users (Application software, 2023). These programs help users perform activities like writing documents, browsing the internet, playing games, or managing data. Unlike system software, which runs the computer’s core functions, application software focuses on practical tasks that users want to accomplish. Examples include word processors, web browsers, and photo editing tools, making everyday computer use easier and more productive.</p>

        <div class="topic-box">
            <h1>IMPLEMENTATION IN THE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY</h1>
            <p>Different kinds of institutions in the community use computer hardware and software in ways that fit their needs and goals. The technology they use helps them work better and connect with the people they serve.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="topic-box">
            <h3>Schools and Universities</h3>
            <p>Schools and Universities use software like Learning Management Systems (LMS) to help students and teachers access lessons, homework, and grades online. They also use Student Information Systems to keep track of enrollment, attendance, and student records. The hardware includes computers, tablets, and servers that make online classes and school management possible. For example, popular LMS platforms like Canvas help schools organize courses and allow students to join virtual classes from anywhere, making learning more flexible.</p>
            
            <h3>Hospitals and Health Centers</h3>
            <p>Hospitals use special software to manage patient records, schedule appointments, and track medical supplies. They rely on hardware like computers, scanners, and servers to store important health information securely and allow fast access for doctors and nurses during treatments. Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems also help hospitals quickly share patient information, improving the care patients receive.</p>
            
            <h3>Government Offices</h3>
            <p>Government offices use software to manage public records, process applications, and keep track of services for citizens. They have computers and secure networks that help workers handle tasks efficiently while protecting personal data and making services easier for the public. Online portals are also common, allowing citizens to apply for documents or pay bills without visiting an office in person.</p>
        
            <h3>Businesses and Companies</h3>
            <p>Businesses use software like Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to track sales and interact with customers, as well as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to manage finances and inventory. Computers, servers, and networks keep all their data organized and make business operations run smoothly. Many businesses also use online tools and mobile apps to reach customers and operate 24/7.</p>

            <h3>Banks and Financial Institutions</h3>
            <p>Banks rely on software to handle transactions, manage accounts, and detect fraud. They use powerful computers and secure data centers to make sure money transfers and records are safe and available anytime customers need them. Mobile banking apps and online platforms also let customers check balances and make payments from their phones, adding convenience.</p>

            <h1>ANALYSIS / REACTION</h1>
            <p>Computer hardware is all the physical parts of a computer that you can see and touch, like the computer itself, the keyboard, mouse, and screen. Hardware is important because it allows us to interact with computers and run different programs. Without hardware, computers wouldn’t be able to work at all because these parts do the actual processing and store data.</p>
            <p>Software is different because it’s not something you can touch. It is made up of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do. Software acts like the brain of the computer, telling it how to perform different tasks. There are two main types of software: system software and application software. System software, like the operating system, manages the hardware and allows other software to work properly. Application software helps users do specific things like write documents, browse the internet, or playgames.</p>
            <p>Hardware and software depend on each other. Hardware needs software to know what tasks to do, and software needs hardware to actually carry out those tasks. Hardware is physical and can wear out overtime, while software is digital and can be copied or changed easily. Software can also have problems like bugs or viruses, but hardware problems are usually physical damage or failure.</p>
            <p>In everyday life, hardware and software are used in many different places. Schools use computers and tablets with software platforms that help students and teachers with lessons and grades. Hospitals use software to keep patient information safe and to help doctors provide better care. Governments use software to make services easier for people, like paying bills or applying for documents online. Businesses use software to manage their sales and inventory, helping them work more efficiently. Banks rely on software for secure transactions and to offer online banking services on phones and computers.</p>
            <p>Together, hardware and software are like a team that makes modern technology possible. Hardware is the body that does the work, and software is the brain that controls it. Knowing about both helps us understand how computers and technology affect our daily lives, from school work to health care to banking. Technology is everywhere, and learning how it works is very useful for today and the future.</p>
