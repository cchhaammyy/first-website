            <h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE AS A DISCIPLINE</h1>
            <p>Computer Science became a discipline in the late 1950s and early 1960s (Southwest Minnesota State University, n.d.). It is the discipline that seeks to build a scientific foundation for such topics as computer design, computer programming, information processing, algorithmic solutions of problems, and the algorithmic process itself (Brookshear et al., 2020).</p>
            <p>Even though computer science addresses both human made and natural information processes, the main effort in the discipline has been directed toward human made processes, especially information processing systems and machines (Denning, 1997).</p>
            <p>It involves learning about how software is made, how computers process information, and how to create programs that can do tasks automatically. It's more than just coding, it's about understanding the rules and logic behind computers and using this knowledge to build helpful tools and technology.</p>

            <h3>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h3>
            <p>Computer Engineering is a field that mixes computer science and electrical engineering to create and maintain computer hardware and software. It involves designing things like computer chips, devices, and the software that makes them work together. Computer engineers work to build smart, efficient technology that we use every day in devices like phones, computers, and even robots.</p>
            <p>Computer Engineering (CE) brings together computing and electrical engineering in a way that embodies the science and technology of design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of software and hardware components of modern computing systems, computer controlled equipment, and networks of intelligent devices (CC2020 Task Force, 2020).</p>
    
            <h3>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h3>
            <p>Computer Science is the study of how computers work and how to use them to solve problems. It includes learning about programming, algorithms, and how software and hardware work together. Computer scientists create new software, design systems, and find ways to make computers solve tasks faster and better. Computer Scientists develop a strong foundation based on mathematics and algorithms (Connolly et al., 2017), which helps them understand and solve problems using computers effectively.</p>
        
            <h3>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h3>
            <p>An Information System is a setup that brings together people, processes, technology, and data to work as a team to handle information. It collects, organizes, stores, and shares data to make it useful for making decisions and solving problems. It’s not just about computers or machines, but also about how people and organizations use information in smart ways.</p>
            <p>Information Systems help businesses and organizations improve how they work, make better choices, and get more done. In simple words, an Information System helps manage and use information in an organized way that makes tasks easier and faster. It includes people, technology, and processes all working together to turn data into useful information that helps reach goals (Staley, n.d.).</p>
        
            <h3>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h3>
            <p>Information Technology (IT) is the use of computers, networks, storage, and other technology to create, process, store, secure, and share data efficiently for personal, organizational, and societal needs. According to Baste et al. (2023), "Information Technology is the study of systemic approaches to select, develop, apply, integrate, and administer secure computing technologies to enable users to accomplish their personal, organizational, and societal goals".</p>
        
            <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h3>
            <p>Software Engineering is about planning, creating, testing, and fixing software to make sure it works well and meets what people need. It uses organized and careful methods to build software that is safe, reliable, and easy to update or fix. Software engineers follow rules and best practices to ensure the software is high quality and meets users’ needs. This area deals with the design of programs and large software systems that meet specifications and are safe, secure, reliable, and dependable (Denning, 1997).</p>

            <h1>ANALYSIS / REACTION</h1>
            <p>The topics that were assigned gave me a clearer and more understanding of computer science as a discipline and its related fields. I realized that computer science is not only about learning programming languages. It also deals with algorithms, logic, and processes that allow computers to solve problems and perform different tasks. What makes it interesting is that it combines theory with application, making it both a science and a practical tool for innovation. This helped me see how computer science serves as a foundation for creating solutions that are useful in school, business, communication, and even in our daily lives.</p>
            <p>Researching about the five computing disciplines and majors (Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, and Software Engineering) also widened my perspective. Each of these fields has its own focus, but they are all connected. Computer engineering works on both hardware and software through computing and electrical engineering. Computer science focuses on algorithms, theories, and problem solving. Information systems emphasize the teamwork of people, processes, and technology to handle data effectively. Information technology is about applying technology in different ways, such as storing, securing, and sharing data. Lastly, software engineering is about planning, building, testing, and maintaining software to make sure it is reliable and meets the needs of users.</p>
            <p>What stood out to me the most is how these disciplines support one another. For example, when creating something like a smartphone, all of these areas are needed. Computer engineers design the hardware, computer scientists handle the algorithms, software engineers create the applications, IT specialists manage data and connectivity, and information systems make the device meaningful for users. This shows that computing is not an individual field but a collaborative one where every specialization is important in building technology that benefits people.</p>
            <p>As I reflect on these topics, I see that studying computing is not only about gaining technical skills but also about taking responsibility. Professionals in this field are expected to create tools and systems that are safe, efficient, and helpful for society. Since technology is already a big part of our everyday lives, those who work in computing carry the responsibility of making sure that innovations are ethical and beneficial. As a student, this makes me appreciate how much technology shapes the world today and inspires me to think about how I can contribute in the future through my own learning and career path.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, these topics showed me that computer science and the five computing disciplines and majors are not just academic lessons but essential areas that shape society now and in the future. Having a good understanding of these fields prepares us, as students, to actively take part in today’s digital world while also preparing us for possible careers in technology.</p>

            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <h3>Educational Background</h3>
            <p>I was already a Carolinian since first grade and moved to Abellana National School in seventh grade, where I remained until tenth grade. Moved back to USC in Senior High School and up until the present, First Year College.</p>

            <h3>Why I Chose BSIT</h3>
            <p>The course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology is not my first choice, it was the course Performing Arts. Since I am the techy person in our family, my parents suggested the BSIT course. I researched a lot about this course and found out that it is very in demand in today’s generation and the salaries are also high. That is why I decided to pursue BSIT even though I have no experience in coding.</p>
